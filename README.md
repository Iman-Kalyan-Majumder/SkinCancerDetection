# Skin Cancer Detection
### Architectured a CNN model for Categorical Classification of Images (Depicting potential skin cancer patients.)
### The dataset was obtained from <a> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000?select=hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv </a>
### RandomOverSampler from imblearn.over_sampling was used to handle the imbalance in the dataset. Thus, there's a possibility of over-fitting. Other techniques like Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Data Augmentation can be implemented to compare their performance.
### Achieved an accuracy of 87%
